# RV64I Processor Modules

This repository contains Verilog modules for a simple RV64I processor, designed to implement key components of the RISC-V RV64I instruction set architecture. The project is a work in progress, and additional features will be added over time.

## Project Progress Checklist

- âœ… **Fetch Unit**: Handles program counter updates and instruction fetching.
- âœ… **Memory Module**: Simulates memory with read and write capabilities.
- âœ… **Register File**: Implements 32 registers with write bypassing and hardwired `x0`.
- âœ… **ALU**: Supports arithmetic, logical, shift, and comparison operations.
- âœ… **Decode Unit**: Decodes RISC-V instructions into their components.
- ðŸŒŒ **Load/Store Unit**: To handle memory operations (`LOAD` and `STORE` instructions).
- ðŸŒŒ **Branch Unit**: To evaluate branch conditions and update the program counter.
- ðŸŒŒ **Integration**: Connect ALU to Decode Unit and complete the processor pipeline.

## Current Features

- **ALU**: Supports arithmetic, logical, shift, and comparison operations.
- **Register File**: Implements 32 registers with write bypassing and hardwired `x0`.
- **Fetch Unit**: Handles program counter updates and instruction fetching with Little-Endian map out.
- **Decode Unit**: Decodes RISC-V instructions into their components.
- **Memory Module**: Simulates memory with read and write capabilities form memory.hex file and dumps the interneal hex file ones sim is done.
- **Control Unit**: Connects all modules and manages instruction flow.

## Planned Features

- **Load/Store Unit**: To handle memory operations (`LOAD` and `STORE` instructions).
- **Branch Unit**: To evaluate branch conditions and update the program counter.
- **Integration**: Connecting all modules into a complete RV64I processor pipeline.

## How It Works

The fetch-decode stage is responsible for fetching instructions from memory and decoding them into their components. The `control` module combines the fetch, decode, and memory modules to simulate this process.

### Example Simulation Output

The following output shows the fetch-decode stage in action:

```
--- Sequential Fetch ---
